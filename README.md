# Latinas in Tech: Event Management

An internal web app built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MUI to streamline event check-ins and member verification for Latinas in Tech. Created and maintained in my role as a Houston Chapter Lead, the tool allows organizers to filter attendees by name or city, sort data, and export attendance to Excel. It integrates with internal APIs to verify membership status in real time, helping simplify check-ins and reporting for member-exclusive events.
